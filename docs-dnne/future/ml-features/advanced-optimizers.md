# Advanced Optimizer Support

## Priority
Medium

## Description
Extend beyond SGD with modern optimization algorithms that are standard in deep learning.

## Motivation
- Adam is the de facto standard for many tasks
- Different optimizers suit different problems
- Learning rate scheduling is crucial for convergence
- Current SGD-only approach is limiting

## Implementation Notes
### Optimizer Nodes
- **AdamOptimizer**: Adaptive learning rates per parameter
- **AdamWOptimizer**: Adam with weight decay decoupling
- **RMSpropOptimizer**: Good for RNNs
- **AdaGradOptimizer**: Adaptive gradient algorithm

### Learning Rate Schedulers
- **StepLRScheduler**: Decay at specific epochs
- **CosineAnnealingLR**: Smooth cosine decay
- **ReduceLROnPlateau**: Adaptive based on metrics
- **WarmupScheduler**: Gradual increase at start

### Integration Pattern
```
Model → Optimizer → LRScheduler → TrainingStep
              ↑
         Epoch/Metric
```

## Technical Considerations
- Maintain optimizer state between steps
- Handle scheduler updates properly
- Support scheduler chaining
- Export templates for stateful optimizers

## Dependencies
- Current optimizer framework
- State management in queue system

## Estimated Effort
Medium

## Success Metrics
- Faster convergence on standard benchmarks
- Support for modern training recipes
- Easy scheduler configuration
