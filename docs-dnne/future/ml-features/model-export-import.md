# Model Export and Import

## Priority
Low

## Description
Save and load trained model weights, with support for standard formats and model versioning.

## Motivation
- Training takes time - need to save results
- Model deployment requires export
- Experiment tracking needs versioning
- Transfer learning requires loading pretrained weights

## Implementation Notes
### Core Features
- **SaveModelNode**: Save model weights/entire model
- **LoadModelNode**: Load saved models
- **ModelCheckpoint**: Auto-save during training
- **ModelVersion**: Track model versions

### Export Formats
- PyTorch native (.pth, .pt)
- ONNX for interoperability
- TorchScript for deployment
- SafeTensors for security

### Integration Pattern
```
Training → EpochTracker → ModelCheckpoint → SaveModel
                                    ↓
                              VersionControl
```

### Advanced Features
- Save best model based on metrics
- Automatic versioning with metadata
- Model compression options
- Partial model saving (specific layers)

## Technical Considerations
- Handle different model architectures
- Preserve optimizer state for resuming
- Metadata storage (hyperparameters, metrics)
- Backwards compatibility

## Dependencies
- Model serialization framework
- File system management
- Metadata storage system

## Estimated Effort
Medium

## Success Metrics
- Seamless save/load workflow
- Support major export formats
- Easy model sharing
- Reliable versioning system
