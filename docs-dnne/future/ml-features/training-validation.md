# Training Validation and Benchmarking

## Priority
High

## Description
Complete full training runs to validate that DNNE can achieve expected accuracy on standard benchmarks.

## Motivation
- Need to prove DNNE works for real ML tasks
- Current system untested on full training runs
- Benchmarks provide confidence to users
- Performance baselines needed

## Implementation Notes
### MNIST Validation
- Run full 5-epoch training cycles
- Target: 98%+ accuracy
- Compare against standard PyTorch implementation
- Document training time and resource usage

### Extended Benchmarks
- CIFAR-10 with CNN
- Simple RL tasks (Cartpole, Mountain Car)
- Custom dataset example
- Multi-GPU training test

### Performance Metrics
- Training time per epoch
- Batch processing rate
- Memory usage
- GPU utilization
- Final accuracy

## Technical Considerations
- Ensure reproducible results
- Fair comparison methodology
- Document hardware used
- Multiple runs for statistics

## Dependencies
- Working export system
- All required nodes implemented
- Performance monitoring tools

## Estimated Effort
Small (for MNIST), Medium (for full suite)

## Success Metrics
- Match PyTorch baseline accuracy
- Training time within 2x of native PyTorch
- Reproducible results
- Clear benchmark documentation
