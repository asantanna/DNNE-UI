# Training Performance Optimization

## Priority
High

## Description
Current MNIST training takes ~3+ minutes per epoch (1875 batches at 10Hz). This needs significant improvement to make DNNE practical for real ML workflows.

## Motivation
- Current training speed is too slow for practical use
- 10Hz batch processing rate is a bottleneck
- Users need faster iteration cycles for experimentation

## Implementation Notes
- Consider increasing batch processing rate for training scenarios
- Add configurable update rates per node type
- Implement batch size optimization recommendations
- Profile the queue-based system to identify bottlenecks
- Consider batching queue operations

## Technical Considerations
- Queue framework may be adding overhead
- Async operations could be optimized
- GPU utilization might not be optimal
- Python GIL could be limiting performance

## Dependencies
- Performance profiling tools
- Understanding of current bottlenecks

## Estimated Effort
Medium-Large

## Success Metrics
- Achieve at least 100Hz batch processing
- Reduce MNIST epoch time to under 30 seconds
- Maintain accuracy while improving speed
